## ⚠️ Problems People face

1. ❌ Manual ITR Filing Process  
   Taxpayers manually input data into ITR forms, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

2. ❌ Disjointed Investment & Tax Tracking  
   Existing solutions manage either investments or tax filing separately, lacking unified insights.

3. ❌ Lack of Real-Time Tax Advice  
   Users can’t get instant, personalized tax-related answers without expert help.

4. ❌ Complex Authentication Flow  
   Aadhaar + PAN integration is cumbersome and not available for simple MVP demos.
